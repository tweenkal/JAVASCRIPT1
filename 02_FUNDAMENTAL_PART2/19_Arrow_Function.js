//ðŸ‘‰Arrow function:-
//ðŸ‘‰Arrow function is simply form for the function expression that is 
//shorter and therfor faster to write.  
//ðŸ‘‰it is lot of easier and faster to write the first reason for 
// that is that we dont need the curly braces like we have here to
// define a code block and second that return actually happens
// implicitly so this value here will automatically be returned 
// without us having to explicitly write the return keyword.
